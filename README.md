# Spiking Neural Network

I made a basic spiking neural network (SNN) to simulate bio-plausible cognitive behavior on conventional hardware. This project illustrates how SNNs, which utilize discrete "spikes" to store and analyze information, can achieve energy-efficient calculations while delivering strong results on the MNIST and CIFAR-100 datasets. 

## Overview

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) represent a potential major shift in the ML industry. They have proven an efficiency advantage over traditional artificial neural networks by copying the discrete nature of biological neurons. Unlike naive neurons that continuously take in values, the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model only spikes when certain conditions are met. This is part of why natural cognition is not nearly as energy-hungry as AI, but can achieve superior results in various aspects. If advances in biology-inspired hardware can catch up (for instance, IBM's TrueNorth chip), the future is bright for SNNs.

This repo includes code for:
- **Basic neural units**: LIF neurons and synapses
- **Population coding**: Groups of neurons for robust and parallelizable representation
- **Learning mechanisms**: Via STDP (spike-timing-dependent plasticity)
- **Data encoding**: Poisson encoding for visual stimuli
- **Visualizations**: For single and groups of LIF neurons, synapses, and Poisson encoding.
